""" get_mental_maps.py: Retrieve and write as .json files all the system support
    maps (ssms) from the ssm database that are generated from the website
    http://syssci.renci.org/ssm-wizard-mental-health-in-schools/. Source for
    this website is available at
    https://github.com/steve9000gi/ssm/tree/wizard-mental-health-in-schools.

    Usage:
        get_mental_maps.py output_directory

    Arg:
        output_directory: a directory into which all the ssm .json files are to
        be written. If it doesn't exist it will be created.

    The "SELECT * from maps" statement returns a list of tuples. Each tuple is
    an ssm plus its associated metadata and is comprised of the following
    elements:

    index type      contents                 column name in database
    ___________________________________________________________________________
    0     int       map id                   id
    1     int       owner id                 owner
    2     dict      the ssm                  document
    3     datetime  created timestamp        created_at
    4     datetime  last modified timestamp  modified_at
    5     str       map name                 name

    The tuples in the list are sorted in ascending order of the elements with
    index 4 (last modified timestamp).

    The element at index 3 in each tuple in the list is a dict which contains
    the actual system support map. For the purposes of this study we're
    interested only in those dicts which contain a "schoolLocation" key
    because only those database elements are generated by the website custom-
    modified for the "Roles in Mental Health Care within Schools in Connecticut"
    research study.

    For each one of those ssms that meets this criterion, print some useful
    tracking info to stdout and write the dict to file in .json format.

    from PostGres database
    -> extract list of tuples
    -> examine each tuple of metadata + dict
    -> write dict with key "schoolLocation" to file
